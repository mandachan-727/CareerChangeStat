In numerous discussions held with industry experts, the subject of career transitions has been a recurring topic. Career specialists tend to bring up their transition from one career, or company, to another within the overall sentiment of a general desire to find a better fit job-wise. More in- depth investigation into career transitions also highlight the significance of training, company prospects, and other pertinent factors in shaping an individual's career trajectory. According to Carless & Arnup (2011), a variety of factors including age, gender and education level can drive oneâ€™s decision to change their career path. Vaitenas & Wiener (1977), on another hand, referred to motivation as an open field of inquiry in its drive towards career changes.

This research project aims to investigate a dataset of individuals who have received training from a prominent Big Data firm and have demonstrated an interest in working for the company. The dataset presents an opportunity to (1) identify key metrics that contribute to an individual's decision to leave their previous job and (2) identify the most suitable candidates for employment within the company. It is key that these metrics are discovered so that this company can discover the best approach to implement their resources, specifically in the career development and recruiting programs.
